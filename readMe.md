# Thrones 

## Q: What is Thrones, you ask? <br>
A: It is so easy for anyone with a phone to find the nearest food, nearest groceries, and even the nearest person waiting in their car to shop deliver those nearest groceries to your home. I know from experience that it is not always as easy to find a restroom accessible to the public on short notice. The worst part is, the longer you are unsuccessful in your search, the more urgent it becomes. Thrones is the answer that people like my Wife have been waiting on for years. Going out with some friends? Pull up the Thrones app to see where the restrooms are near you, with instructions on how to access them, ratings and reviews from other Thrones users, and more! <br>

## Q: How do you install Thrones?<br>
A: Thrones can be accessed by simply using the URL "www.Thrones.io" or by downloading the Android app! I'd make an IOS version, but I don't have Mac money. Apple users, I am taking donations is this is something you seem interested in. I'll need to buy a Mac, and learn the appropriate programming languages, so it could take a while.<br>

## Q: What is the intended use of this Thrones?<br>
A: Thrones is intended to be used for convenience.<br>

## Q: How can developers contribute to Thrones?<br>
A: undefined<br>

## Q: Test Instructions:<br>
A: Testing is simple. You can perform test calls to the Thrones API. Alternatively, you can simply use the app to test its accuracy.<br>
